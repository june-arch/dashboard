# Kenstack Mantine Prisma

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It leverages [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev/), [Bun](https://bun.sh/), and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to provide a robust and modern web development stack.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
